                    <h1>ISLAM</h1>
                    <p>THE Islamic dawa’ah foundation [IDF], Wichita USA, is a non-profit organization, that promote the
                        Islamic dawa’ah by removing the misconception and negative sentiment about Islam to the none
                        Muslim.
                    </p>
                    <p>IDF;S Try its level best to provide much information to the understand and excellent teaching of
                        Islam with the help of Qur'an and authentic Hadith, based on logic and reasoning. IDF’s propose
                        is
                        Invite all to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and good instruction, in a way that is best. </p>
                    <p>ISLAM is a faith that every prophet sends by God preached to his people, culminating in the
                        message
                        brought by the last and final prophet, Muhammad, peace mercy and blessing be upon him[pbuh]. The
                        holy prophet [pbuh] called people toward the belief in one God, AS a obedience, surrender,
                        submission, sincerity and peace to the will of ALLAH. ALLAH subhanwata’allah tells us in the
                        holy
                        Qur’an that he send the holy prophet Muhammad [pbuh] as a source of mercy for humanity; We sent
                        thee
                        not, but as a Mercy for all creatures
                        [21 verse 107]
                    </p>

                    <h2>THE CONCEPT OF GOD IN ISLAM</h2>

                    <p>The most concise definition of God in Islam is given in the four verses of Surah Ikhlas which is
                        Chapter 112 of the Qur’an:

                        Say: He is Allah,
                        The One and Only.
                        "Allah, the Eternal, Absolute.
                        "He begets not, nor is He begotten.
                        And there is none like unto Him." <br>
                        [Al-Qur’an 112:1-4]
                    </p>

                    <p>The word ‘Assamad’ is difficult to translate. It means ‘absolute existence’, which can be
                        attributed
                        only to Allah (swt), all other existence being temporal or conditional. It also means that Allah
                        (swt) is not dependent on any person or thing, but all persons and things dependent on Him </p>

                    <p>The meaning of ikhlas is purification of our belief from worshipping many gods. The surah start
                        with
                        the word qul which mean to say or declare. The versa tell us to declare that ALLAH is one.[ahad]
                        with this declaration we confirm that god is one, there is no any God except him . after
                        declaration, we also testifies that he is as-samad , the word means one who is eternal absolute
                        the
                        one that live forever. One who is independent. He does not need anyone or anything but everyone
                        and
                        everything need him.</p>

                    <h3>The 99 Names and Attributes of Allah</h3>
                    <p>This is a unique and special miracle in the holy Qur’an to the regard to having the right concept
                        and
                        knowledge of who the creator of heavens and earth is. Who deserved to be worship. If one should
                        ask
                        any learned man, how many attributes of GOD can he or she point out? I’m sure he /she cannot go
                        beyond a dozen. But the holy Qur’an gave the Muslim as well as the hole mankind 99 attributes of
                        GOD. These are as follows. </p>

                    <p>Now! by reading these attributes of the creature. one should know whom he or her creator is. In
                        other to do that one should put whomever he or she worship to the test using these attributes I
                        just list. If it passes the test then he deserve to be worship. Many Muslims recite the names as
                        one of the forms of dhikr (remembrance) to <b> develop their awareness, believe, understanding
                            and
                            Reliance of Allah</b>. As well as it benefit to mankind. Abu Huraira reported the Prophet
                        Muhammad as saying:
                        There are 99 names of Allah; he who commits them to memory would get into paradise.

                    <h1>CONCEPT OF GOD IN CHRISTIANITY </h1>
                    <p>The major difference between Islam and Christianity is that Christians’ insistence on the
                        supposed
                        divinity of Christ (pbuh). As to being GOD while the Muslim believe that he is not GOD but he is
                        a
                        one
                        of the mightiest messenger of GOD. Islam is the only non-Christian faith, which makes it an
                        article
                        of
                        faith to believe in Jesus (pbuh). No Muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus (pbuh).
                        Islam
                        believe he was the Messiah translated Christ (pbuh). he was born miraculously, without any male
                        intervention, which many modern day Christians do not believe. he gave life to the dead with
                        God’s
                        permission. he healed those born blind, and the lepers with God’s permission .that raise a

                        jesus say I am GOD? Did he say worship me? There is no single , simple straight clear statement
                        .unequivocal from the lips of jesus where he say such a thing. On the contrary Jesus says</p>
                    <p>(i) “…I with the finger of God cast out devils….”
                        [The Bible, Luke 11:20] <br>
                        (ii) “…I cast out devils by the Spirit of God….”
                        [The Bible, Mathew 12:28 <br>
                        (iii) “I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgement is just; because
                        I
                        seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.”

                        (v) “My Father is greater than all.”

                        1] <b> God Sent Jesus’ (pbuh)</b>
                        The Bible mentions the prophetic nature of Jesus (pbuh) mission in the following verses: <br>
                        (a)”… and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.”
                        [The Bible, John 14:24] <br>
                        (b)”And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ,
                        whom
                        thou has sent.”
                        [The Bible, John 17:3]
                    </p>

                    <p>2] <b> Jesus did not claim Divinity</b> <br>
                        the Bible shows us clearly that he did not claim divinity, it is amazing Jesus [pbu] did not
                        want
                        you to call him good, even to call him GOD; for example,.
                        “And behold, one came and said unto him, ‘Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may
                        have
                        eternal life?’
                    </p>

                    <p>And he said unto him, ‘Why callest thou me good? There is none good but one, that is, God: but if
                        thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.’ ” <br>
                        [The Bible, Mathew 19:16-17] <br>
                        Jesus (pbuh) did not say that to have the eternal life of paradise, man should believe in him as
                        Almighty God or worship him as God, or believe that Jesus (pbuh) would die for his sins. On the
                        contrary he said that the path to salvation was through keeping the commandments. It is indeed
                        striking to note the difference between the words of Jesus Christ (pbuh) and the Christian dogma
                        of
                        salvation through the sacrifice of Jesus (pbuh).

                        THE ONENESS OF GOD AND THE CONDEMNATION OF IDIOL WORSHIP IN THE BIBLE
                    </h3>
                    <p>We can see that the bible tell us the unity and oneness of God in the book of Isiah, for example
                        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                            <li> “I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.”
                                [The Bible, Isaiah 43:11] </li>
                            <li>
                                “I am Lord, and there is none else, there is no God besides me.”
                                [The Bible, Isaiah 45:5] </li>
                            <li>
                                “I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me.”
                                [The Bible, Isaiah 46:9] </li>

                            Whereby on the other hand GOD condemned idol worship in the following verses.
                            “You shall have no other gods before Me.
                            <li>“You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in
                                heaven
                                above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; 5 you
                                shall
                                not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God <br>
                                [The Bible, Exodus 20:3-5]
                            </li>
                            Again is mention in the bible, <br>
                            ‘You shall have no other gods before Me.

                            <li>‘You shall not make for yourself a carved image—any likeness of anything that is in
                                heaven

                                shall
                                not bow down to them nor serve them. For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, <br>

                <div class="dawah">
                    <h2>WHAT IS DAWA’H?</h2>
                    <p>Dawa’h means a call or an invitation. When a Muslim call all to the way of thy lord with wisdom
                        and a
                        beautiful preaching, is non as dawa’h. Most Muslims know that Islam is a universal religion,
                        meant
                        for all mankind. Allah ( S W A) is the Lord of the entire Universe, and Muslims have been
                        entrusted
                        with the duty of conveying His message to all mankind. Allah (S W A) says in the holy Qur'an,
                        "Let
                        there arise out of you a band of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining what is right,
                        and
                        forbidding what is wrong: they are the ones to attain felicity." (Al-Qur'an 3:104).
                        "Invite (all) to the way of thy Lord, with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and argue with them
                        in
                        ways that are best and most gracious!" [Al-Qur'an 16:125].
                        "Who is better in speech than one who calls (men) to Allah, works righteousness, and says, "I am
                        of
                        those who bow in Islam"?" (Al-Qur'an 41:33)
                        The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "Convey (my teachings) to the people even if it were a single sentence,
                        and
                        tell others the stories of Bani Israel (which have been taught to you), for it is not sinful to
                        do
                        so. And whoever tells a lie on me intentionally, will surely take his place in the (Hell) Fire."
                        sahih al- Bukhari vol. 4 hadith 3461.?
                        The purpose.
                        the purpose of da‘wah is to invite people, both Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the
                        worship
                        of Allah as expressed in the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the holy prophet Muhammad [ p b u].

                    <p>Tawheed and Categories:
                        Islam believes in ‘Tawheed’ which is not merely monotheism i.e. belief in one God, but much
                        more.
                        Tawheed literally means ‘unification’ i.e. ‘asserting oneness’ and is derived from the Arabic
                        verb
                        ‘Wahhada’ which means to unite, unify or consolidate.
                        Tawheed can be divided into three categories: <b> Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah, Tawheed
                            al-Asmaa-was-Sifaat, Tawheed al-Ibaadah.</b>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                            <li> <b> Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah (maintaining the unity of Lordship)</b></li>

                            <p>The first category is ‘Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah’. ‘Ruboobeeyah’ is derived from the root
                                verb
                                “Rabb” meaning Lord, Sustainer and Cherisher.
                                Therefore ‘Tawheed-ar-Ruboobeeyah’ means maintaining the unity of Lordship. This
                                category is
                                based on the fundamental concept that Allah (swt) alone caused all things to exist when
                                there
                                was nothing. He created or originated all that exists out of nothing. He alone is the
                                sole
                                Creator, Cherisher, and Sustainer of the complete universe and all between it, without
                                any
                                need
                                from it or for it.
                            </p>

                            <li><b>Tawheed al-Asmaa was-Sifaat (maintaining the unity of Allah’s name and attributes):
                                </b>
                            </li>

                            <p> The second category is ‘Tawheed al Asmaa was Sifaat’ which means maintaining the unity
                                of
                                Allah’s name and attributes. This category is divided into five aspects:

                                <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
                                    <li>Allah should be referred to as described by Him and His Prophet
                                        Allah must be referred to according to the manner in which He and His prophet
                                        have
                                        described Him without explaining His names and attributes by giving them
                                        meanings
                                        other than their obvious meanings.
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Allah must be referred to as He has referred to Himself
                                        Allah must be referred to without giving Him any new names or attributes. For
                                        example Allah may not be given the name Al-Ghaadib (the Angry One), despite the
                                        fact
                                        that He has said that He gets angry, because neither Allah nor His messenger
                                        have
                                        used this name.
                                    </li>
                                    <li> Allah is referred to without giving Him the attributes of His creation
                                        In a reference to God, we should strictly abstain from giving Him the attributes
                                        of
                                        those whom He has created. For instance in the Bible, God is portrayed as
                                        repenting
                                        for His bad thoughts in the same way as humans do when they realise their
                                        errors.
                                        This is completely against the principle of Tawheed. God does not commit any
                                        mistakes or errors and therefore never needs to repent. <br>
                                        The key principle when dealing with Allah’s attributes is given in the Qur’an in
                                        Surah Ash-Shur

                                        “There is nothing
                                        Whatever like unto Him,
                                        And He is the One
                                        That hears and sees (all things).” <br>
                                        [Al-Qur’an 42:11]
                                        <br>
                                        Hearing and seeing are human faculties. However, when attributed to the Divine
                                        Being
                                        they are without comparison, in their perfection, unlike when associated with
                                        humans
                                        who require ears, eyes, etc. and who are limited in their sight and hearing in
                                        terms
                                        of space, time, capacity, etc.

                                    </li>

                                    <li>God’s creation should not be given any of His attributes
                                        To refer to a human with the attribute of God is also against the principle of
                                        Tawheed. For example, referring to a person as one who has no beginning or end
                                        (eternal).
                                    </li>

                                    <li>Allah’s name cannot be given to His creatures
                                        Some Divine names in the indefinite form, like ‘Raoof’ or ‘Raheem’ are
                                        permissible
                                        names for men as Allah has used them for Prophets; but ‘Ar-Raoof’ (the Most
                                        Pious)
                                        and Ar-Raheem (the most Merciful) can only be used if prefixed by ‘Abd’ meaning
                                        ‘slave of’ or ‘servant of’ i.e. ’Abdur-Raoof’ or ‘Abdur-Raheem’. Similarly
                                        ‘Abdur-Rasool’ (slave of the Messenger) or ‘Abdun-Nabee’ (slave of the Prophet)

                                    <li><b>Definition and meaning of ‘Ibadaah’:</b></li>
                                    <p>‘Tawheed al-Ibaadah’ means maintaining the unity of worship or ‘Ibaadah’. Ibaadah
                                        is derived from Arabic word ‘Abd’ meaning slave or servant. Thus Ibaadah means
                                        servitude and worship.<br><br></p>

                                    <li>All three categories to be followed simultaneously.

                                    </li>
                                    <p> Only believing in the first two categories of Tawheed without implementing
                                        Tawheed-al-Ibaadah is useless. The Qur’an gives the examples of ‘Mushrikeens’
                                        (idolaters) of the Prophet’s time who confirmed the first two aspects of
                                        Tawheed. It is mentioned in the Qur’an:<br><br>
                                        “Say: ‘Who is it that
                                        Sustains you (in life)
                                        From the sky and from the earth?
                                        Or who is it that
                                        Has power over hearing
                                        And sight? And who
                                        Is it that brings out
                                        The living from the dead
                                        And the dead from the living?
                                        And who is it that
                                        Rules and regulates all affairs?’
                                        They will soon say, ‘Allah’.
                                        Say, ‘Will you not then
                                        Show piety (to Him)?’ ”
                                        [Al-Qur’an 10:31]<br><br>
                                        A similar example is repeated in Surah Zukhruf of the Glorious Qur’an:<br><br>
                                        “If thou ask them, Who
                                        Created them, they will
                                        Certainly say, ‘Allah’: how
                                        Then are they deluded
                                        Away (from the Truth)?”
                                        [Al-Qur’an 43:87] <br> <br>
                                        The pagan Meccans knew that Allah (swt) was their Creator, Sustainer, Lord and
                                        Master. Yet they were not Muslims because they also worshipped other gods
                                        besides Allah. Allah (swt) categorized them as ‘Quffaar’ (disbelievers) and
                                        ‘Mushrikeen’ (idol worshippers and those who associate partners with God).<br>
                                        <br>
                                        “And most of them
                                        Believe not in Allah
                                        Without associating (others
                                        As partners) with Him!”
                                        [Al-Qur’an 12:106]<br><br>

                                        Thus ‘Tawheed al-Ibaadah’ i.e. maintaining the unity of worship is the most
                                        important aspect of Tawheed. Allah (swt) alone deserves worship and He alone can
                                        grant benefit to man for his worship.

                    <h2>Dialog</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a dialog between me and a group of christen missionaries. I will like to share this
                        dialogs with the viewers Insha’Allah. So we will all benefit from it. So it was a few days back,
                        I was on my way home from work while I met a group of missionaries. They call to my attention,
                        and introduce their self to me as missionaries of the christen faith. Suddenly
                        Pete: start by saying hey’ ibrahim did you knew that just accepting the lord Jesus Christ as
                        your lord and savior you will earn salvation?
                        Ibrahim; how so ?
                        Pete : the bible say. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
                        believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.[john 3;16
                        Ibrahim: I take it that, you think Jesus [pbu] is the one and only son of God. <br>
                        Pete: of cures.
                        Ibrahim: well according to your holy bible God had sons be the tongue, for examples; that the
                        sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves,
                        whomever they chose[Genesis 6;2]
                        "Israel is My son, My firstborn. [exodus 4;22]
                        The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God,[romans 8;16] <br>
                        him:
                        Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD [job 1:6]
                        "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.[ Mathew 5:9]
                        For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.[romans 8;14]
                        See I can go on and on mentioning how many times sons of God is listed in the holy bible. <br>
                        Pete: no I mean to say he is the only begotten son of God. There is no one ever called the
                        begotten son of God except Jesus……..
                        Pete see …… what do you have to say about that now ibrahim?
                        Ibrahim: oh actually I do have something to say about that, pete it seems that you are being
                        worried about the word begotten which is another subject of discussion. Let see what the bible
                        say about the word begotten since that is you biggest worries. The bible say in the book of
                        psalm. "I will surely tell of the decree of the LORD: He said to Me, 'You are My Son, Today I
                        have begotten You. [psalm 2:7].
                        Sister pam: ibrahim. The bible say somewhere that, No one has ascended into heaven except the
                        One who descended from heaven--the Son of Man…..and the person the bible is talking about is no
                        one but Jesus Christ. <br>
                        Ibrahim: I will reply in the following ways. First how did jesus descend from heave when gospel
                        of Luke tell us that when he was eight day old he was circumcise and name Jesus by the angels
                        when he was in his mother’s womb. See he was born of a woman. Second. Jesus according to the
                        bible he is not the only one who ascended to heaven. the bible say, "By faith Enoch was taken up
                        so that he should not see death; AND HE WAS NOT FOUND, because God had taken him. Now before he
                        was taken he was attested as having pleased God." [Hebrews 11:5] again. And it happened, as they
                        still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,
                        and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. [2 king 2:11]. <br>
                        Pete: did you know that for Jesus sake our sins are forgiven? Because he came and die for our
                        sins so we can earn salvation. He get himself crucified for us.
                        Ibrahim: To the regard to the original sins question to be ask here is did he die as a man or he
                        dies as God?<br>
                        Pete: I will tell you …… see! Umm I…… well in short did you know how he die? Hold on Jesus die
                        as man to wash away our sins.
                        Ibrahim: no! one man can not carry the sins of the whole world. You know that. And if you say he
                        die as God you mean to say God died? <br>
                        …… what sin did jesus die for Pete if you don’t mind me
                        asking? Because to my own understanding there are two types of sins logically speaking.
                        Pete: well you tell me those two types of sins. Just so to let you know any sins you can think
                        of, he Jesus already died for it.
                        Ibrahim: as I was saying there are two types of sins. First is the sin that father adam and eve
                        if did according your holy bible non as the original sin. The second types of sin is the one
                        that take place in our daily life. Now let see what the bible say about the two types of sin I
                        just mentioned. If you read [Genesis 3 :16-17] God already punished them both. I read. To the
                        woman He said, "I will greatly multiply Your pain in childbirth, In pain you will bring forth
                        children; Yet your desire will be for your husband, And he will rule over you." 17Then to Adam
                        <br>
                        He said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten from the tree
                        about which I commanded you, saying, 'You shall not eat from it'; Cursed is the ground because
                        of you; In toil you will eat of it All the days of your life. Again if you read the book of
                        Isiah. God say, I alone am the one who is going to wipe away your rebellious actions for my own
                        sake. I will not remember your sins [anymore]. [Isiah 43:25] <br>
                        Ibrahim: oh and again book of Ezekiel make it very clear. it says, 20"The person who sins will
                        die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear
                        the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself,
                        and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself. 21"But if the wicked man turns from all
                        his sins which he has committed and observes all My statutes and practices justice and
                        righteousness, he shall surely live; he shall not die. [Ezekiel 18:20-21]. This verse tell us
                        that God is not going to hold us accountable for the sin that father Adam did. and he will not
                        hold father Adam responsible for our sins. did you see you see my point of view now Mr Pete!
                        <br>
                        Pete: will you like to come to our church on Sunday to continuous this discussion with the
                        elders?
                        Ibrahim: sure, here is my e-mail islamicdawafoundationdaee@gmail.com hope to hear from your
                        church soon.
                        Pete: It nice meeting you. Honestly if not because I had the bible with me I would think you
                        don’t know the scripture, but my bible confirms every verse you quoted.
